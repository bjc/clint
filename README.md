# CLosure INTerrupt handlers

This crate allows you to use closures for interrupt handlers in a
heapless, no-std environment.

# Example Code

See the `examples` directory for some simple examples.

For a slightly more complex example [this
repository](https://github.com/bjc/nrf52-demo.git) uses clint to blink
some LEDs and measure temperature across a number of interrupts and
exceptions.
